    <p class="lead">
      I am an engineer by formation, curious and energetic - that applies technology to solve real-world problems. Personally, I’m a very easy going, sociable, fast-learner, curious and natural leader. I do what I love, and I love what I do. I lead by example and work side by side with my teams.   
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
      I am a deliberate jack of all trades, master of none. My profile is a hybrid of technical and managerial experience, but always related to technological projects. I bring business and product vision to tech teams, partly thanks to having started an developed a company. I am a fast learner, curious to see how technology can improve the users experience in multiple areas. I have a strong motivation and sense of responsibility with myself, my team and clients (or peers), and people like my positive and easy going, can-do attitude.
